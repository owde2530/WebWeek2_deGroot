      <p> In the age of Westward expansion in the United States, in the mid 19th century to early 20th century,<br>
        cowboys were a common occupation, depiste their present illustriousness. Cowboys were workers who typically<br>
        herded cattle over long distances, on a seasonsal basis. At the time, this was considered a respectable and<br>
        commonplace job. However, with time, the job took on a more nebulous role of that of the pioneer, the bandit,<br>
        all morphed into this general conception of "cowboy."</p>

        can mean to say cavalier or baudy in a uniquely American way. The British sense of the word cowboy, in<br>
        in fact, means just this. </p>
